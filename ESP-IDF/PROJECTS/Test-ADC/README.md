# EXAMPLE OF ADC

This code show you how to correctly use the ADC on ESP32 with ESP-IDF lenguaje.

## NOTE IMPORTANT

I test the ADC to read an intervall of Voltage [0-3.3]V come from a 4x20 mA conversor like [this](https://electronilab.co/tienda/modulo-convertidor-de-senal-corriente-a-voltaje-4-20ma-a-0-3-3v-5v-10v/), with needed of very lowest resolution posible, but the rsults can be do the expected
